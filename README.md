# File Structure
There is one branch for this course containing four chapter folders corresponding to the four chapters in the course. Inside these chapter folders are the coding exercise files. The naming convention for the exercise files is CHAPTER#_MOVIE#. As an example, the branch named 02_03 corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

All coding exercise files will have a beginning and an end state, for example '02_03e' would be the ending file for the third movie in the second chapter. These are marked with the letters b for "beginning" and e for "end". The b file contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The e file contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.
